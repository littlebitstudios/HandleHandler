        <p>
            This website is designed to be a unified way to share social media profiles.<br>
            We support a variety of websites already, and the site is open-source, meaning you can contribute to improving it!
        </p>
        <p>
            These websites work using the standard handle format (@username@domain):<br>
            <strong>Instagram, Twitter, Lens Protocol (Hey/Orb), Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, Mastodon, and possibly many others.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            This website also works with some usernames that do not include the second @ symbol:<br>
            <strong>ENS names (someone.eth), Bluesky Social profiles (someone.bsky.social), and general website domains (example.com and a few other TLDs.).</strong>
